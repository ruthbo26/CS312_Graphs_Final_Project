# CS312_Graphs_Final_Project


In this project you will build a graph with a dataset of your choice (from three options given
to you) to represent entities and connections between those entities. You will be given
some datasets to choose from, such as a variation of the Hollywood Graph in which,
vertices are actors and edges connect actors that have appeared in a movie together
(figure below), or a Congress Bills Graph in which, vertices are US congresspersons and
edges connect members of congress that have co-sponsored legislative bills together.


Questions Set 1:
1 - What representation is being used for the graph in the code provided, Adjacency Matrix or Adjacency List? The code above represents an Adjaceny List.
2 - Every function in the Graph class has a comment that describes what the function does. How is that achieved and what is its time efficiency? Specifically, for each function in the Graph.cpp file, except the overloaded output operator:
a. Explain what each line of code in the function does. Do not repeat the comment that has been provided for the function, which describes the general purpose of the function. Do this by adding a comment at the end of the line.
b. Give the Big-O time of the function. Write it as comment before the function header.
