# CS312_Graphs_Final_Project


In this project you will build a graph with a dataset of your choice (from three options given
to you) to represent entities and connections between those entities. You will be given
some datasets to choose from, such as a variation of the Hollywood Graph in which,
vertices are actors and edges connect actors that have appeared in a movie together
(figure below), or a Congress Bills Graph in which, vertices are US congresspersons and
edges connect members of congress that have co-sponsored legislative bills together.
